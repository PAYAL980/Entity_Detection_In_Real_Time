# Entity_Detection_In_Real_Time
 This project primarily spots entities like vehicles, persons, electronic devices, animals, birds, food items, home furnishing items and many other inanimate objects
 in images, videos and in real time as well using device cameras. The model is trained using YOLO(You Only Look Once) convolution neural network.


For example in this image, the project is able to spot many objects and persons.
